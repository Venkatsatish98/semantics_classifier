# semantics_classifier

There are times when a user writes Good, Nice App or any other positive text, in the review and gives 1-star rating. Your goal is to identify the reviews where the semantics of review text does not match rating. 

The goal is to identify such ratings where review text is good, but rating is negative- so that the support team can point this to users.

The dataset "chrome_reviews.csv" has been used in the project

The file "model_pickle" is the model which is selected by performing accuracy check on different machine learning classification algorithms.
